/*
 * CONTROL FLOW:
 * Control flow is the order in which the computer preforms statements. Usually
 * code is read from the first line to the last line but you can change that using
 * control flow. There are multiple different control flow methods:
 * If statements, If-Else statements, else statements, and switch statements.
 */

// 1. If Statements //
/*
 * An if/else statements preforms a block of code if a condition is true. So the
 * code will run until it returns true. So if it returns false then it will run the 
 * next code.
 */

//Example: 
var text = 'hello'

if(text === 's') {
    return 'world'
} else if(text === 'h') {
    return 'world'
} else if(text === 'hello') {
    return 'world' // evalutes to true so it will run this code and stop!
} else {
    return false
}

// 2. Else If Statements //
/* 
 * else if statements are used to create a new test if the first statement was
 * false.
 */

// 3. Else //
/*
 * To specify a block of code to be executed. This is if none of the code was 
 * true it will run the else statement to stop.
 */

// 4. Switch //
/*
 * The switch statemnet is aconditional statement that is used to preform
 * different actions based on different conditions.
